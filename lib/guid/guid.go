	`guid.New` generates a string that functions as a unique identifier.

	This is roughly based on some "betterguid" stuff based on firebase "push ids", though rather tweaked to a slightly different aesthetic.
	IDs generated will be roughly chronologically sortable (they'll occur in runs, anyway; in the long run they'll loop, because we don't
	*really* care about monotonicity guarantees; we're really just after some loose clustering behavior as a politeness to humans debugging).
	They're also lowercase and punctuation free except for some non-semantic dashes that are just there to make visual breaks (again, for
	no reason but politeness on the eyes of a human doing debugging on something).

	These are *not* uids in any rfc4122 sense of the word, if that wasn't already clear.

	The guids are returned as ascii strings.
	It's strongly advised that the consumers of this library define some other type alias for various kinds of IDs to keep them clearly separated.

	There is no recommended canonical/dense binary encoding or mapping back to numbers, and there are no multiple encodings;
	this is a random ID generator, not a message-bearing serialization format!

	This implementation has a global mutex such that multiple guids requested in the same millisecond still are roughly
	chronologically sortable.  Totally a performance bottleneck.  If you're generating enough guids in practice to care, use something else.
