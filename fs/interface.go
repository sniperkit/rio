		filesystem: rooted symlinks or excessive '..' segments still
		yield paths within the FS basepath.
		For example, `ResolveLink("../../..", "./lnk")` yields "./".

		This may opt to be bug-for-bug compatible with linux path resolution:
		specifically, for paths like "/untraversable/../target", where the first
		dir is 0000, we will return a permissions error... despite being able
		to clearly see that the following ".." will make the question irrelevant.
